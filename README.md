# heritage


The purpose of heritage was simple: fix this highly annoying friends' situation:

Imagine you're friends with people who love going to electronic parties and listening to electronic music, and you have a mixer, such as the [Pioneer - DDJ400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/es-419/product/controller/archive/ddj-400/black/overview/) and you usually play with your friends in "Being a Disc Jockey" and start DJing with friends at home and sometimes carrying the mixer to other places.
What happens? 

> **EVERYONE WANTS TO PLAY AND CREATE THEIR OWN PLAYLISTS **
> 
because the mixer is like a TOY for them. 

They ask, _"hey man, today I added a new song, can you download it?"_ and they don't know anything about computers. 
What would you do?:
- [ ] Download the 50 songs per playlist of your 4-5 "DJ-Friends" manually?
- [ ] Look every day if your friends added or removed songs from their playlists and update it?
- [x] use heritage to **completely** avoid that annoying situation.

This terminal-based app allows you to fully forget that situation and makes downloading, updating, and removing songs something really easy and automated.

Playlists (Spotify / YouTube) songs of your friends will be synced locally with a base laptop.

> _(Yeah, I know, this thing solves something completely specific for mine, but you know how this world is........._

This was never meant to be public, but just maybe someone is experiencing a similar situation and this could save some headaches.
(i want also save this as a memory pointer to one of the best moments of my life: raving)

Anyway, the results are good -> It makes DJ switching a smooth process, the same goes for playing to be 'DJs' and getting everything synced everyday.
_(yeah i know real djs don't download music on this way and don't prepare sets on this way but who cares? this is for fun)_

## install?
this was never meant to be public, so if you feel this is useful for solving any problem that you have, let me know and I will complete this section, otherwise? this repo is akin a `memory pointer to funny moments`

>>>>> `Let me please stand up, what is this? Hypnotize! say this... Just a moment, NO. Mixer, poison, all things go, the reason? Monster tube! Let's dance, Detuner`
